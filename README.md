# Solar-system-simulation
Solar system simulation in pythin using pygame
This is a project i've been working on besides my physic studies, i wanna try to do an accurate (in the limits of my knowledge ofc) solary system simulation using python. 
It's also making me train global dev knowledge and tools such as git and pycharm.
Hope you enjoy it as much as i do !
